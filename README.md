# minishell
A project that involves creating a basic shell program in the C programming language. The goal is to replicate the functionality of a standard shell, such as the ability to execute commands, handle input and output redirection, and handle errors. The project requires a good understanding of system calls and process management in C.

I completed this project with [Richard Meuth](https://github.com/binarycamper)
